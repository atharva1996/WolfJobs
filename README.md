# WolfJobs
Need a side Hustle or want to get some quick rewards? Wolfjobs provides the perfect platform to meet your requirements.

A job portal which provides recruiters a platform to post temporary job openings and an oppurtunity for candidates to apply for the jobs without being concerned about permanent associations. 

# Why WolfJobs?
Unlike the Job Portals that display only Permanent job positions, WolfJob focuses on providing Temporary positions to anyone who wants to work for a limited period of time.

Be it a short-time Technical requirement or hiring a short-term Cashier for a dining place, WolfJobs covers it all! 
Every user associated with WolfJobs has a choice to Post a job or Apply for a job. WolfJobs provides a universal account for a specific user so that He/She can manage the applications as well as job postings efficiently!

Let's say that a Teaching Assistant is going on a vacation and needs a pair of hands to grade a particular exam having many students. He/She can post a requirement in WolfJobs stating the pay/rewards for the job. 
Let's assume the same Teaching Assistant has some free time and want to know if there are any temporary requirements for grading any other course. Thus, He/She can search the jobs in WolfJobs and apply for the same.
